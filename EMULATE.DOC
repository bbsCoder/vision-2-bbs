Emulation Doc's
Written By: Nocturnus
For ViSiON/2 .84 THE REVision

  ViSiON/2 has the ability to support mutiple menus.  To do this, you must
run EMULATE.EXE.  EMULATE.EXE is simple to use, so the doc file will be
short.  The commands are, PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN are used in the usual manner,
ESC quit's and saves the emulation setup,  F10 exit's and doesn't save and F5
will add a new menu.  Now lets say you are looking at the current menu, which
is default, you see:

Emulation Name:  The name of the current emulation, can be the persion who
                  made the menu set.
Text Directory:  The directory to where the menus are stored.  Must be
                  different then any other menu dir. ie: c:\vision\menu2
Use Arrow Keys:  If yes, this menu set allows the use of cursor keys in the
                  message and file bases.
Min. Level    :  This is the lowest level allowed to use this menu.
Max. Level    :  This is the highest level allowed to use this menu.
Access Flags  :  If the users access flags are equal to what the user has set
                  for his access flags, they can use this menu, if not they
                  will not be able to access it.
Access Number :  This is used respectbaly.  If you add another emulation and
                  you currently have only one emulation set up, the next one
                  you add will be 2.

  Thats all for the Emulation Doc's
