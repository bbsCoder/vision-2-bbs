Menu Editing Doc's
Written By: Nocturnus
For ViSiON/2 .84 THE REVision

  ViSION/2 has now added the configurability of many Public Domain softwares
by adding the menu editing feature.  Now you can make your ViSiON/2 look like
whatever you decide.  Now on with the info.

  First you need to make sure you have everything set up correct, after that
you can run the MENUEDIT.EXE file and start configuring you BBS.  Now there
are all the defalut menus, and I will include examples in here for your
understanging.  All you need to do is check to see if the commands are correct.
Now I will attempt to explain all the menu commands. Here we go...


-- Using MENUEDIT.EXE --

  After running MENUEDIT.EXE, you will see a list of menus that you may edit
and a list of commands at the bottom of the screen.  These commands are to
EDIT, you should press F10 or ENTER,  to delete a menu hit F2, and to add a
menu hit F5.  lets say you would like to edit, so lets say it's the main menu,
so just goto where it says the menu title is MAIN MENU, and hit F10 or ENTER.
After that you will be brought to another menu.  Time to describe these.

Menu Title      :  The title of the menu
Fallback Menu   :  If a menu doesn't exist, it will goto this menu.  Usually
                    the MAIN Menu.
Help File       :  The ansi to be displayed if the user hit's ?.
ASC Required    :  <MORE ON THIS LATER>
Force Menu Level:  If a user has this level or below, they will always see
                    the Help File.
Menu Password   :  If password enter, user must enter this password to get to
                    the menu.
Clear Screen    :  <NOT USED>
Use Menu Prompt :  If set to yes,
Prompt Line 1   :  The menu prompt displayed for the current menu.  You may
                    use an external ANSI file here by putting this for the
                    prompt: %%<directory and filename> ie:
                    %%c:\vision\menus\main.ans
Prompt Line 2   :
Force File Conf.:  File conference to be forced for this menu.
Force Msg. Conf.:  Message conference to be forced for this menu.
Force Hot Keys  :  If set to YES, user can just enter the command and not
                     have to press return.

  To start editing the menus, enter F10.  Now, you can actually change the
menus around and change commands.  Now you will see the list of commands used
for the MAIN MENU,  commands for this screen are, F2 to delete a command, F5
to add a commnad, and Enter to edit a command.  Since this screen is
self-explainatory, I will go on.  Say you want to edit the first command, so
hit enter.  You can hit ALT-H to get a list of menu commands from here Now you
can change the commands, a descripton of the commands are:

Command Description:  Just a little desctiption of the menu.
Keystroke          :  The letter of the command, ie: M to goto the messages.
Commands           :  What menu command will take you where.  Every command
                       need's to be seperated by a ;
ACS Level          :  User must have this level or above.
Hidden             :  Will this command be hidden to users?

  Here are some examples of commands that can be used.  Lets say that you
want to goto the message section and you have 2 conferences, the command
would look like so:


^L;CM;^L;ST1;ST3;^P;^$MESSAGE


This does:

^L, clear screen, CM, asks you for what conference, ST1/ST3 displays the
status screen (in MCICODES.TXT), ^P, pauses the screen, and ^$MESSAGE loads
the message menu.  Now, if your like me, I have it set up for a New Scan
menu, so this is how mine looks.


^L;CM;^L;ST1;ST3;^P;^$MSGNS


It does the same as the above,  but instead of loading the message menu, it
loads the Message Newscan menu, which looks like this:

Command Description  Keystrokes        Command(s)

Message Newscan       Y                MN;^$MESSAGE
Message Newscan       ^M               MN;^$MESSAGE
Abort Newscan         N                ^$MESSAGE
Quit To Main          Q                ^$MAIN


  Now, if the user hit's Y or ENTER, it will go in and Newscan the current
conference, and it they hit N, it will abort the newscan, and if they hit Q
it will go back to the main menu.  Since I use the interal prompt, I have
mine set like this:

Use Menu Prompt : Y
Prompt Line 1   : |CR|09Scan for new messages? (Y/n):
  or you could make you prompt line 1 like:
%%c:\vision\menus\msgns.ans
  That will display the ansi MSGNS.ANS from you menu directoy.


  That should be a good enough doc file for you to understand.  Now this is a
list of all the menu commands you can use with ViSiON/2.  If you need some
more help, leave mail to Crimson Blade on Thieft Of Services.
