
ACS - Access Conditioning System

'Quick Reference by Crimson Blade'

    ACS is widely used system which allows a sysop to grant and
restrict access to various parts of the BBS.  This system is now
a part of ViSiON/2.  With ACS, you can 'fine tune' access to
menu commands depending on many factors.

Command       Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
!             a 'NOT' flag, switches true and false.
()            V/2 processes anything within ()'s first.
|             'OR' flag, true if either two compared variables pass
A             true of user has ANSI/Avatar graphics
Bxxx          true if baud is >= 'xxx', where is 24,48,96,192,etc
Cx            true if message conferences = 'x'
Dxx           true if file level is > 'xx'
Exx           true is PCR (post/call ratio) passes, if 'xx' is blank,
              user's set PCR will be used.
Fx            true if 'x'(a-z) flag is set for current user
Hx            true if current time hour = 'x'
Ixxxxx        true if last user input = 'xxxxx'
L             true if local
Pxx           true if uses has more than 'xx' file points
Sxx           true if user level is >= 'xx'
Txx           true if user's time left is >= 'xx'
Uxx           true if user number = 'xx'
V             true if user level is >= specified login level
Xx            true if file conf = 'x'
Yhh:mm/hh:mm  true if current time is within hh:mm/hh:mm am/pm required
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: All 'xxx' variables mentioned above should be lower case or
      numeric.

If you are not familiar with using ACS, here are some examples to help
explain this system.

S50                    : Command will run if user level is greater than
                         or equal to 50.
!S50                   : Command will NOT run if user level greater than
                         or equal to 50.
S50D50                 : Command will run if user level is >= 50 AND user
                         file level is >= 50.
S25Fa                  : Command will run if user level is >= 25 AND user
                         has the flag 'A' set.
S100|Fb                : Command will run if user level is >= 100 OR user
                         has the 'B' flag set.
Y1:00 am/3:00 pm       : Command will be run if the time is within 1:00 am
                         and 3:00 pm
E30|X1                 : Command will run if user's PCR is >= 30 OR if file
                         conference = 1
(AB96S25Fd)|S100       : Command will run if user has ANSI, is at 9600 bps
                         or higer, has a user level 25 or more, and has
                         flag 'D' set, OR it will run if user has a level
                         set of 100 or greater.
Evision                : Command will run if user's last input was 'vision'
